;;; Commentary:

;; Some text editors save text files with long lines, and they
;; automatically break these lines at whitespace, without actually
;; inserting any newline characters.  When doing `M-q' in Emacs, you
;; are inserting newline characters.  This file provides a file format
;; which automatically fills the long lines when reading a file and
;; unfills the lines when saving the file.

;; There is also a mode function, so you can do stuff like the
;; following:
;;
;; (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.ll\\'" . longlines-mode))
;;
;; This means that all `.ll' files are assumed to have long lines
;; which will be decoded on reading an encoded on writing.

;; If you want to check wether it worked or not, invoke
;; `longlines-show-hard-newlines'.
;;
;; If you want to prevent certain lines from being wrapped, customize
;; `longlines-nowrap-regexp'
